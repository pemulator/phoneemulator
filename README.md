## Please note!
This is not an actual phone emulator. It is a recreation of the phone's UI and made right into your browser. It does not have all of the functionalities as a regular iPhone. Call this a simulation if you will.

This is also the official and only account for PhoneEmulator. Do not be fooled by imposters!
